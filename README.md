This project is a real-time license plate detection and recognition system built using YOLOv8 for object detection and Python for processing. It captures live video input, detects license plates in real-time, and uses OCR to extract readable text from them. Ideal for applications like vehicle tracking, automated toll systems, and smart parking solutions.
